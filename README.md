# 100DaysOfSwift
A repo to showcase my work during the 100Days of Swift learning, so I can begin my journey into learning mobile development

## Day One
A simple introduction into how Swift does integers, doubles, strings, variables and constants. Does a better job than some of my intro 100-level CS courses of these basic ideas, but makes sense when given there isn't any time constraints in this course compared to my CS courses. Now that this is done though, time to move onto day two.

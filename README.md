# 100DaysOfSwift
A repo to showcase my work during the 100Days of Swift learning, so I can begin my journey into learning mobile development

## Day One
A simple introduction into how Swift does integers, doubles, strings, variables and constants. Does a better job than some of my intro 100-level CS courses of these basic ideas, but makes sense when given there isn't any time constraints in this course compared to my CS courses. Now that this is done though, time to move onto day two. 

## Day Two
Again, I really do like the pace of these first few days, as it allows you to build up a portfolio of basic examples that you can come back to as you work on harder and more complex applications. Excited for the future, and curious to see what will come next.
